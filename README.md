# Knight’s Tour

## Description:
This little one’s about bringing the knight's tour into a C program. Basically making the chess knight move across a board trying to visit as many squares as it can without repeating.
it’s a greedy version, meaning it just goes for the first move that’s possible and doesn’t think ahead. This prevents it from performing a magical/nearly magical square. So it doesn't get very far. 

it started simple but ended up being a bit of a maze. However a good learning experience cannot be understated. Working with arrays and learning about typedef changed things for me.
The program contains two main logic functions, one that runs a single greedy run from a given coordinate, and another that attempts them all and prints a resultant matrix which displays the success rate
at each starting point.
